## Overview

This is the first challenge I've entered on Frontend Mentor and it's also my first time creating a front end project.

As I'm a complete newbie to front end programming, I followed as much of the clues and directions given by the Frontend Mentor team as I could.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

- Figma template: [My template](https://www.figma.com/file/41wkc3AsBLAuXertRP7beu/stats-preview-card-component?node-id=0%3A1)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://nathannieg.github.io/frontendmentor-stats-preview/)

## My process

- Step 1 - The template
  Seeing as the template is only available to pro users, I created my own based on the .png images provided.

- Step 2 - Starting version control
  I used GIT to start version control and upload the code to my profile on Github.

- Step 3 - Setting up the HTML structure
  The next step was creating the whole HTML structure by defining divs and classes. I'll later user those classes to reference the HTML code on my CSS stylesheet.

- Step 4 - Styling with CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
