## Overview

This is the first challenge I've entered on Frontend Mentor. As I'm a complete newbie to front end programming, I followed as much of the clues and directions given by the Frontend Mentor team as I could.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

### Links

- [Solution on my Github profile](https://github.com/nathannieg/frontendmentor-stats-preview)
- [My template](https://www.figma.com/file/41wkc3AsBLAuXertRP7beu/stats-preview-card-component?node-id=0%3A1)
- [Live site](https://stats-preview-ng.netlify.app/)

## My process

- Step 1 - The template
  Seeing as the template is only available to pro users, I created my own based on the .png images provided.

- Step 2 - Starting version control
  I used GIT to start version control and upload the code to my profile on Github.

- Step 3 - Setting up the HTML structure
  The next step was creating the whole HTML structure by defining divs and classes. I'll later user those classes to reference the HTML code on my CSS stylesheet.

- Step 4 - Styling with CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Overlay - I can easily say the biggest challenge was figuring out how to set the purple overlay. I learned that one of the solutions is creating a container and then an img tag inside of it. The source should be set with the css property "content" so that you can easily adapt your code to differente screen sizes. The mix-blend-mode property should then be applied to the image, and not to its div parent.

- Manipulating images - Another big challenge was learning how to properly fit images into containers, specially when they're set via CSS.
