## Overview

This is the first challenge I've entered on Frontend Mentor. As I'm a complete newbie to front end programming, I followed as much of the clues and directions given by the Frontend Mentor team as I could.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

### Links

- Solution URL: [Solution on my Github profile](https://github.com/nathannieg/frontendmentor-stats-preview)
- Figma template: [My template](https://www.figma.com/file/41wkc3AsBLAuXertRP7beu/stats-preview-card-component?node-id=0%3A1)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://nathannieg.github.io/frontendmentor-stats-preview/)

## My process

- Step 1 - The template
  Seeing as the template is only available to pro users, I created my own based on the .png images provided.

- Step 2 - Starting version control
  I used GIT to start version control and upload the code to my profile on Github.

- Step 3 - Setting up the HTML structure
  The next step was creating the whole HTML structure by defining divs and classes. I'll later user those classes to reference the HTML code on my CSS stylesheet.

- Step 4 - Styling with CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To be completed

### Continued development

I still haven't figured out how I can set up the purple layer over the picture without adding the image through CSS code. I built the project inserting the image via HTML, so I still have to do some research around that.
